This is the single-file early version of our 2022 FRC robot code.
I contributed to the mecanum drive logic, vision alignment concepts
(PhotonVision), and general robot behaviour during the main season.
The team later expanded and modularized this code during the off-season,
but this file reflects the original structure we used during development.
