# FRC Robot Code Archive – Qubit Robotics (2021 & 2022)

This repository contains **archived robot code from the 2021 and 2022 FRC seasons**, developed while I was a software member of **Qubit Robotics**.  
The original files were stored in our team drive/GitHub.  
This repo includes cleaned and documented versions to showcase my contributions.

## 🗂 Seasons Included
### **2021 Season**
- Early shooter + intake prototypes  
- Basic drivetrain control tests  
- Initial sensor integration  
- Pneumatics tests  
- Control logic experiments  

### **2022 Season**
- Full competition-ready robot code  
- Shooter speed modes (distance-based + manual)  
- Ball detection with ColorSensorV3  
- Automated intake & shooting cycles  
- Finalized pneumatics control (intake & shooter solenoids)  
- Hopper + belt subsystem logic  
- TimedRobot structure and complete teleop behaviors  

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries
- **Python (WPILib)**
- REV ColorSensorV3 (I2C)
- DifferentialDrive (arcadeDrive)
- Pneumatics: Compressor + DoubleSolenoid
- PWMVictorSPX motor controllers
- Timer-based autonomous-like logic
- SpeedControllerGroups
- Joystick mappings (Xbox + Flightstick)

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented Across Both Seasons
- Adjustable chassis speed
- Shooter speed configuration (manual & zone-based)
- Color-based ball detection  
- Automated ball intake cycle  
- Automated ball shooting cycle  
- Pneumatics for both shooter & intake  
- Hopper + belt coordinated movement  
- Safe motor shutdown logic  
- Clean and modularized subsystem functions

## 📌 My Role & Contributions
During 2021–2022 I worked on:

- Shooter + intake logic design  
- Ball detection integration using the REV color sensor  
- Pneumatics control (intake & shooter solenoids)  
- Motor speed tuning & subsystem coordination  
- Hopper + belt system behavior  
- Debugging code during robot tests  
- Writing, organizing and maintaining Python code  
- Assisting with drivetrain controls and teleop logic  

I was part of both seasons’ software subteam and actively contributed to robot testing and code deployment.
